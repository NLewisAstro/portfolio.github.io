Homework 2, Portfolio
This is my responsive portfolio that for now just holds a formatted layout that I have in mind for the future. I would like to expand on it when we get to react. I tried to focus more on the responsive formatting to hone in those skills for the future. This is my first time in the coding/programming world, so I don't have alot of personal information to include.
